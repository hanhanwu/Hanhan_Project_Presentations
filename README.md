DATA SCIENCE PRESENTATIONS

* Introduce Spark to SFU Linguistics Lab
 * <b>2017 Spring</b>
 * <b>Duration</b>: 30 minutes
 * <b>Audience</b>: SFU Linguistics Lab, the lab I am doing Research Assistant work, they all have programming experience
 * <b>Presentation Purpose</b>: to introduce Spark with relative simple NLP examples, they will use some of these basic concepts in one of their research projects.
 * [Presentation PPT][9] 
 * [Demo Code][10]
 * <b>Observations</b>: I wanted to finish everything within 30 minutes inlcuding to answer their questions, so the demo I made was super simple. The good news is, I made them realize how great Spark is, especially when we were discussing Hadoop and Spark. There is one things I could improve, they appeared to be very interested in executing things in parallel, but in my demo, dind't show them an example does parallel work. In the future, if I need to do demo work, it is better to make it closely related to the previous features I have talked about, within the time limit.

HUMAN COMPUTER INTERACTION (HCI)

* Lead Discussion - Gathering Requirements & Task Centered Design
 * <b>Feb. 2, 2017</b>
 * <b>Duration:</b> 1h
 * <b>Topic:</b> Gathering Requirements & Task Centered Design
 * <b>Audience:</b> The Whole HCI Class
 * <b>Presentation Purpose:</b> Encourage studnets to discuss and help them learn/deepen the HCI knowledge/skills through the discussion
 * [Presentation PPT][5]
 * <b>Why did I design the PPT in this way:</b> My goal is to help stuents learn and encourage them to discuss, without expecting all of them have done the readings or remember many details in the readings.
 * <b>Results:</b> I am very happy that they kept talking during the whole 1 hour, some of them obviously dind't do the readings, but they were also contributed valuable ideas proactively! Through the talk, they have learned the process of Task-Centered Design and strengthened their skills in requirements gathering as well as user interface design.
 * <b>Observations</b> 1) People will talk a lot when they can relate to the senario/situation. 2) People like brain storming, just need to give them a detailed strory background, they can talk more. 3) When time is short, instead of asking them to design the whole thing, encouraging them to make judgements on my design, judgements and arguments are all pretty good here because when they are discussing, they start to think deeper with the knowledge & experience they have gained.

Cyber Security & Program Analysis

* [Present a paper - DieHarder: Securing the Heap][7]
 * <b>Feb 7, 2017</b>
 * <b>Duration:</b> 30 minutes
 * <b>Topic:</b> Talk about the DieHarder paper
 * <b>Audience:</b> The Whole Program Analysis & Security Class
 * <b>Presentation Purpose:</b> Digest this paper and present it with examples to help the whole class understand deeper about the topics, also, the professors hopes there will be class discussion
 * [My Slides][6]
 * [Team Presentation Slides][8]
 * <b>My presentation experience...</b>: Everything in OS class is heartbreaking... The mini projects, the coming final project, the critique writing and the presentation (I was so proud of my presenting skills...) When my schedule is very busy, preparing for this presentation really made me "die harder". Look, the whole team has 30 minutes to talk, the paper is so difficult for me to understand because my OS knowledge is close to 0, how to present so many things within 10 miuntes with easy-to-understand examples was a big challenge for me. I tried my best to read the paper again and again, checking relative papers, presentations, finally, I managed to create 5 slides, and designed with easy-to-understand examples, I also designed the PPT in a way to prevent stdents from asking questions, because I really don't know deeper. For some parts in the paper, no matter how did I try to research, still puzzled me, so I used some methods to skip those confusing part. As I expected, the students really felt they understood everything I was talking about, and as I expected, they dind't have any questions for my part. However, I forgot there was the professor (this is the very first class presentation), who will ask questions to encourage students to think deeper and understand better. And, he did ask a question I really could not undersatnd in the paper. It was a little embarassing that the professor had to come to draw a picture and explain that.... Next time, if I don't understand some part, I am going to ask the professor directly before the presentation, in case he will ask questions I don't know.... This class, really swallowed all of my pride...

* [Present a paper - SourcererCC: Scaling Code Clone Detection to Big Code][11]
 * <b>Mar 14, 2017</b>
 * <b>Duration:</b> 2h
 * <b>Topic:</b> SourcererCC, detect code clone on big code
 * <b>Audience:</b> The Whole Program Analysis & Security Class
 * <b>Presentation Purpose:</b> Digest this paper and present it with examples to help the whole class understand deeper about the topics, also, discuss further about the technology in this area
 * [Team Presentation Slides][12]
 * About this paper, I think their algorithm looks interesting but just like many other papers, they may lie with stastics visualization, what they mentioned about their contribution may not be true, the way they evaluate their solution and compare with other competitive tools have too many problems, the comparisons even made me feel unfair to other studies. But, it's interesting to read this paper and to learn from the class discussion. And, code clone is a technology used in plagiarism, althoug when I was checking MOSS (the tool used by school program plagiasm detection) paper, I felt they are hiding some information because it is a tool used for plagiasm detection. Today, I just heard that Stackoverflow has copyright for each code posted, it's weird, when I put my code there or on GitHub, I am intend to let people copy my code or the idea of my code....
